# About Koji
Koji is doing to code/apps what YouTube did to video... democratizing it so that millions more people can be creators.  

When YouTube launched (2005) many people wondered if there was any need for a platform that would let amateurs broadcast video.  

They asked questions like : 

* Why would anyone want to broadcast?  
* Why would anyone watch videos created by amateurs?  
* Why would any brand pay to advertise on amateur produced video? 

Looking back on it now it seems silly, but it was hard to answer those questions at the time. 

Today, people may ask the same questions :  

* Why would amateurs want to create apps?
* Why would anyone want to interact with / use apps created by amateurs?
* How is anyone going to make money?

Of course if we look back, we have seen these patterns repeating (and producing Unicorn companies)...

* Democratization of Text --- Blogger / WordPress 
* Democratization of Photography --- Flickr / Instagram
* Democratization of Video --- Veoh / YouTube
* Now it is time for democratization of Code/Apps --- Koji

Koji is a multisided marketplace which allows professional developers to create "app templates" that can then be customized by less/non technical people (we call them Makers). Once customized, these new apps can be easily deployed to the Internet.  

Koji's apps are modern "Progressive Web Apps" that run on any browser and every device, without the need to install anything, and completely bypassing mobile app stores. This means that any app built on Koji can instantly be used on personal computers, mobile phones, tablets, and any consumer electronics device that has a browser (refrigerators, televisions, game consoles, Facebook Portal, Tesla automobiles)... everywhere!

Just like YouTube started with people posting low quality videos (that later got dramatically better), today, people are creating various trivialities using Koji.  You can see what they are creating here.  We are already seeing these apps get more sophisticated, people learning from each other, a community of developers building, and app template creation accelerating.  Because Koji supports modern day standards (full-stack JavaScript), there are no limitations on the kinds of apps that will be created.

The company has raised $6M to date from a list of prominent investors.
