# Privacy policy

Effective date: 04/15/2020

We at GoMeta, Inc. (&quot;GoMeta,&quot; &quot;Koji,&quot; &quot;we,&quot; and &quot;us&quot;) know you care about how your personal information is used and shared, and we take your privacy seriously. Please read the following to learn more about our Privacy Policy. By using or accessing the Services in any manner, you acknowledge that you accept the practices and policies outlined in this Privacy Policy, and you hereby consent that we will collect, use, and share your information in the following ways.

Remember that your use of GoMeta&#39;s Services is at all times subject to the [Terms of Use](http://withkoji.com/resources/terms) , which incorporates this Privacy Policy. Any terms we use in this Policy without defining them have the definitions given to them in the [Terms of Use](http://withkoji.com/resources/terms).

**What does this Privacy Policy cover?**

This Privacy Policy covers our treatment of personally identifiable information (&quot;Personal Information&quot;) that we gather when you are accessing or using our Services, but not to the practices of companies we don&#39;t own or control, or to people that we don&#39;t manage. We gather various types of Personal Information from our users, as explained in more detail below, and we use this Personal Information internally in connection with our Services, including to personalize, provide, and improve our Services, to allow you to set up a user account and profile, to contact you and allow other users to contact you, to fulfill your requests for certain products and services, and to analyze how you use the Services. In certain cases, we may also share some Personal Information with third parties, but only as described below.

As noted in the [Terms of Use](http://withkoji.com/resources/terms), we do not knowingly collect or solicit personal information from anyone under the age of 16. If you are under 16, please do not attempt to register for the Services or send any personal information about yourself to us. If we learn that we have collected personal information from a child under age 16, we will delete that information as quickly as possible. If you believe that a child under 16 may have provided us personal information, please contact us at [contact@gometa.io](mailto:contact@gometa.io).

**Will GoMeta ever change this Privacy Policy?**

We&#39;re constantly trying to improve our Services, so we may need to change this Privacy Policy from time to time as well, but we will alert you to changes by placing a notice on the Services, by sending you an email, and/or by some other means. Please note that if you&#39;ve opted not to receive legal notice emails from us (or you haven&#39;t provided us with your email address), those legal notices will still govern your use of the Services, and you are still responsible for reading and understanding them. If you use the Services after any changes to the Privacy Policy have been posted, that means you agree to all of the changes.

**What Information does GoMeta Collect?**

_Information You Provide to Us:_

We receive and store any information you knowingly provide to us. For example, through the registration process and/or through your account settings, we may collect Personal Information such as the following:

- First and last name
- Email address
- Telephone number
- Credit/debit card information

If you provide your third-party account credentials to us or otherwise sign in to the Services through a third party site or service, you understand some content and/or information in those accounts (&quot;Third Party Account Information&quot;) may be transmitted into your account with us, and that Third Party Account Information transmitted to our Services is covered by this Privacy Policy; for example, if you log into our Services through your Google account. Certain information may be required to register with us or to take advantage of some of our features.

We may communicate with you if you&#39;ve provided us the means to do so. For example, if you&#39;ve given us your email address, we may send you promotional email offers on behalf of other businesses, or email you about your use of the Services. Also, we may receive a confirmation when you open an email from us. This confirmation helps us make our communications with you more interesting and improve our services. If you do not want to receive communications from us, please indicate your preference by contacting us at [contact@gometa.io](mailto:contact@gometa.io).

_Information Collected Automatically_

Whenever you interact with our Services, we automatically receive and record information on our server logs from your browser or device, which may include your IP address, geolocation data, device identification, &quot;cookie&quot; information, the type of browser and/or device you&#39;re using to access our Services, and the page or feature you requested. We may use this data to customize content for you that we think you might like, based on your usage patterns. We may also use it to improve the Services â€“ for example, this data can tell us how often users use a particular feature of the Services, and we can use that knowledge to make the Services interesting to as many users as possible.

Cookies: &quot;Cookies&quot; are identifiers we transfer to your browser or device that allow us to recognize your browser or device and tell us how and when pages and features in our Services are visited and by how many people. Our advertising partners may also transmit cookies to your browser or device, when you click on ads that appear on the Services. Also, if you click on a link to a third party website or service, a third party may also transmit cookies to you. Cookies can either be &quot;session cookies&quot; or &quot;persistent cookies&quot;. Session cookies are temporary cookies that are stored on your device while you are visiting our Website or using our Service, whereas &quot;persistent cookies&quot; are stored on your device for a period of time after you leave our website or Services. We&#39;ve provided a quick summary of some of the cookie types we and our service providers use on the Services, but for more information about cookies, visit [http://www.allaboutcookies.org/](http://www.allaboutcookies.org/).

- Essential Cookies: Essential cookies are required for providing you with features or services that you have requested. For example, certain cookies enable you to log into secure areas of our Services. Disabling these cookies will make certain features and services unavailable.
- Functional Cookies: Functional cookies are used to record your choices and settings regarding our Services, maintain your preferences over time and recognize you when you return to our Services. These cookies help us to personalize our content for you, greet you by name, and remember your preferences (for example, your choice of language or region).
- Performance/Analytical Cookies: Performance/analytical cookies allow us to understand how visitors use our Services such as by collecting information about the number of visitors to the website, what pages visitors view on our website and how long visitors are viewing pages on the website. Performance/analytical cookies also help us measure the performance of our advertising campaigns in order to help us improve our campaigns and the Service&#39;s content for those who engage with our advertising.
- Retargeting/Advertising Cookies: Retargeting/advertising cookies collect data about your online activity and identify your interests so that we can provide advertising that we believe is relevant to you.

We may use this data to customize content for you that we think you might like, based on your usage patterns. We may also use it to improve the Services - for example, this data can tell us how often users use a particular feature of the Services, and we can use that knowledge to make the Services interesting to as many users as possible. You may be able to change the preferences on your browser or device to prevent or limit your device&#39;s acceptance of cookies, but this may prevent you from taking advantage of some of our features. Our advertising partners may also transmit cookies to your browser or device, when you click on ads that appear on the Services. Also, if you click on a link to a third party website or service, such third party may also transmit cookies to you. Again, this Privacy Policy does not cover the use of cookies by any third parties, and we aren&#39;t responsible for their privacy policies and practices. Please be aware that cookies placed by third parties may continue to track your activities online even after you have left our Services, and those third parties may not honor &quot;Do Not Track&quot; requests you have set using your browser or device.

_Information Collected From Other Websites and Do Not Track Policy_

Through cookies we place on your browser or device, we may collect information about your online activity after you leave our Services. Just like any other usage information we collect, this information allows us to improve the Services and customize your online experience, and otherwise as described in this Privacy Policy. Your browser may offer you a &quot;Do Not Track&quot; option, which allows you to signal to operators of websites and web applications and services (including behavioral advertising services) that you do not wish such operators to track certain of your online activities over time and across different websites. Our Services do not support Do Not Track requests at this time, which means that we collect information about your online activity both while you are using the Services and after you leave our Services.

**Will GoMeta Share Any of the Personal Information it Receives?**

We may share your Personal Information with third parties as described in this section:

Information that&#39;s been de-identified. We may de-identify your Personal Information so that you are not identified as an individual, and provide that information to our partners. We may also provide aggregate usage information to our partners (or allow partners to collect that information from you), who may use such information to understand how often and in what ways people use our Services, so that they, too, can provide you with an optimal online experience. However, we never disclose aggregate usage or de-identified information to a partner (or allow a partner to collect such information) in a manner that would identify you as an individual person.

Advertisers: We allow advertisers and/or merchant partners (&quot;Advertisers&quot;) to choose the demographic information of users who will see their advertisements and/or promotional offers and you agree that we may provide any of the information we have collected from you in non-personally identifiable form to an Advertiser, in order for that Advertiser to select the appropriate audience for those advertisements and/or offers. For example, we might use the fact you are located in San Francisco to show you ads or offers for San Francisco businesses, but we will not tell such businesses who you are. Or, we might allow Advertisers to display their ads to users with similar usage patterns to yours, but we will not disclose usage information to Advertisers except in aggregate form, and not in a manner that would identify you personally. Note that if an advertiser asks us to show an ad to a certain audience or audience segment and you respond to that ad, the advertiser may conclude that you fit the description of the audience they were trying to reach.

We may deliver a file to you through the Services (known as a &quot;web beacon&quot;) from an ad network. Web beacons allow ad networks to provide anonymized, aggregated auditing, research and reporting for us and for advertisers. Web beacons also enable ad networks to serve targeted advertisements to you when you visit other websites. Because your web browser must request these advertisements and web beacons from the ad network&#39;s servers, these companies can view, edit, or set their own cookies, just as if you had requested a web page from their site. You may be able to opt-out of web beacon tracking conducted by third parties through our Services by adjusting the Do Not Track settings on your browser; please note that we don&#39;t control whether or how these third parties comply with Do Not Track requests.

Affiliated Businesses: In certain situations, businesses or third party websites we&#39;re affiliated with may sell or provide products or services to you through or in connection with the Services (either alone or jointly with us). You can recognize when an affiliated business is associated with such a transaction or service, and we will share your Personal Information with that affiliated business only to the extent that it is related to such transaction or service. One such service may include the ability for you to automatically transmit Third Party Account Information to your Services profile or to automatically transmit information in your Services profile to your third party account; for example, if you log onto our Services through your Google account. We have no control over the policies and practices of third party websites or businesses as to privacy or anything else, so if you choose to take part in any transaction or service relating to an affiliated website or business, please review all such business&#39; or websites&#39; policies.

Analytics: We may use third party analytics service providers, such as Google Analytics for our business purposes, including but not limited to improving and developing our Services, monitoring and analyzing use of our Services, and increasing the functionality and user-friendliness of our Services. Google Analytics may collect and retain some information about you by planting a persistent cookie or identifier on your web browser or device. You may opt out of Google Analytics by visiting [https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout/](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout/). Google&#39;s ability to use and share information collected by Google Analytics about your use of the Services is restricted by the Google Analytics Terms of Service and the Google Privacy Policy. You may find additional information about Google&#39;s ability to use and share information collected by Google Analytics by visiting [www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/](http://www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/).

Agents: We employ other companies and people to perform tasks on our behalf and we need to share your information with them to provide products or services to you; for example, we may use a payment processing company to receive and process your credit card transactions for us. Unless we tell you differently, our agents do not have any right to use the Personal Information we share with them beyond what is necessary to assist us.

User Profiles and Submissions: Certain user profile information, including your name, location, and any content that you have uploaded to the Services, may be displayed to other users to facilitate user interaction within the Services or address your request for our services. Your account privacy settings may allow you to limit the other users who can see the Personal Information in your user profile and/or what information in your user profile is visible to others. Please remember that any content you upload to your public user profile, along with any Personal Information or content that you voluntarily disclose online in a manner other users can view (on discussion boards, in messages and chat areas, etc.) becomes publicly available, and can be collected and used by anyone. Your user name may also be displayed to other users if and when you send messages or comments or upload images or videos through the Services and other users can contact you through messages and comments. Additionally, if you sign into the Services through a third party social networking site or service, your list of &quot;friends&quot; from that site or service may be automatically imported to the Services, and such &quot;friends,&quot; if they are also registered users of the Services, may be able to access certain non-public information you have entered in your Services user profile. Again, we do not control the policies and practices of any other third party site or service.

Business Transfers: We may choose to buy or sell assets, and may share and/or transfer customer information in connection with the evaluation of and entry into such transactions. Also, if we (or our assets) are acquired, or if we go out of business, enter bankruptcy, or go through some other change of control, Personal Information could be one of the assets transferred to or acquired by a third party, and we would share Personal Information with the party that is acquiring our assets. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any acquirer of us or our assets may continue to use your Personal Information as set forth in this policy.

Protection of GoMeta and Others: We reserve the right to access, read, preserve, and disclose any information that we believe is necessary to comply with applicable law or court order or respond to valid legal process, including from law enforcement or other government agencies; enforce or apply our [Terms of Use](http://withkoji.com/resources/terms) and other agreements; prevent spam or other unwanted communications and investigate or protect against fraud; protect the rights, property, or safety of GoMeta, our employees, our users, or others; or maintain the security of our products and services.

**Is Personal Information about me secure?**

Your account is protected by a password for your privacy and security. If you access your account via a third party site or service, you may have additional or different sign-on protections via that third party site or service. You must prevent unauthorized access to your account and Personal Information by selecting and protecting your password and/or other sign-on mechanism appropriately and limiting access to your computer or device and browser by signing off after you have finished accessing your account.

We endeavor to protect the privacy of your account and other Personal Information we hold in our records, but unfortunately, we cannot guarantee complete security. Unauthorized entry or use, hardware or software failure, and other factors, may compromise the security of user information at any time.

**What Personal Information can I access?**

Through your account settings, you may access, and, in some cases, edit or delete the following information you&#39;ve provided to us:

- First and last name
- Email address
- Telephone number
- Credit/debit card information
- User profile information, including code, images, and videos you have uploaded to the site

The information you can view, update, and delete may change as the Services change. If you have any questions about viewing or updating information we have on file about you, please contact us at [contact@gometa.io](mailto:contact@gometa.io).

**What choices do I have?**

You can always opt not to disclose information to us, but keep in mind some information may be needed to register with us or to take advantage of some of our features.

You may be able to add, update, or delete information as explained above. When you update information, however, we may maintain a copy of the unrevised information in our records. You may request deletion of your account by sending an email to [contact@gometa.io](mailto:contact@gometa.io). Some information may remain in our records after your deletion of such information from your account. We may use any aggregated data derived from or incorporating your Personal Information after you update or delete it, but not in a manner that would identify you personally.

**EU Residents**

If you are a resident of the European Union (&quot;EU&quot;), United Kingdom, Lichtenstein, Norway, or Iceland, you may have additional rights under the EU General Data Protection Regulation (the &quot;GDPR&quot;) with respect to your Personal Data, as outlined below.

For this section, we use the terms &quot;Personal Data&quot; and &quot;processing&quot; as they are defined in the GDPR, but &quot;Personal Data&quot; generally means information that can be used to individually identify a person, and &quot;processing&quot; generally covers actions that can be performed in connection with data such as collection, use, storage and disclosure. GoMeta will be the controller of your Personal Data processed in connection with the Services.

If there are any conflicts between this section and any other provision of this Privacy Policy, the policy or portion that is more protective of Personal Data shall control to the extent of such conflict. If you have any questions about this section or whether any of the following applies to you, please contact us at [contact@gometa.io](mailto:contact@gometa.io).

**What Personal Data Do We Collect From You? **

We collect Personal Data about you when you provide such information directly to us, when third parties such as our business partners or service providers provide us with Personal Data about you, or when Personal Data about you is automatically collected in connection with your use of our Services. For more information, please refer to &quot;What Information does GoMeta Collect?&quot;

**How Do We Use Your Personal Data?**

We process Personal Data to operate, improve, understand and personalize our Services. For example, we use Personal Data to:

We will only process your Personal Data if we have a lawful basis for doing so. Lawful bases for processing include consent, contractual necessity and our &quot;legitimate interests&quot; or the legitimate interest of others, as further described below.

- Contractual Necessity: We process the following categories of Personal Data as a matter of &quot;contractual necessity&quot;, meaning that we need to process the data to perform under our Terms of Use with you, which enables us to provide you with the Services. When we process data due to contractual necessity, failure to provide such Personal Data will result in your inability to use some or all portions of the Services that require such data.
  - Your full name

**How and With Whom Do We Share Your Data? **

We share Personal Data with vendors, third party service providers and agents who work on our behalf and provide us with services related to the purposes described in this Privacy Policy or our Terms of Service. These parties include:

- Payment processors
- Fraud prevention service providers
- Ad networks
- Analytics service providers
- Staff augmentation and contract personnel
- Hosting service providers

Furthermore, if we choose to buy or sell assets, user information is typically one of the transferred business assets. Moreover, if we, or substantially all of our assets, were acquired, or if we go out of business or enter bankruptcy, user information would be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party, and we would share Personal Data with the party that is acquiring our assets. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any acquirer of us or our assets may continue to use your Personal Information as set forth in this policy

**How Long Do We Retain Your Personal Data?**

We retain Personal Data about you for as long as you have an open account with us or as otherwise necessary to provide you Services. In some cases we retain Personal Data for longer, if doing so is necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes or collect fees owed, or is otherwise permitted or required by applicable law, rule or regulation. Afterwards, we retain some information in a depersonalized or aggregated form but not in a way that would identify you personally.

**What Security Measures Do We Use? **

We seek to protect Personal Data using appropriate technical and organizational measures based on the type of Personal Data and applicable processing activity.

Personal Data of Children: As noted in the [Terms of Use](http://withkoji.com/resources/terms), we do not knowingly collect or solicit Personal Data from anyone under the age of 16. If you are under 16, please do not attempt to register for the Services or send any Personal Data about yourself to us. If we learn that we have collected Personal Data from a child under age 16, we will delete that information as quickly as possible. If you believe that a child under 16 may have provided us Personal Data, please contact us at [contact@gometa.io](mailto:contact@gometa.io).

**What Rights Do You Have Regarding Your Personal Data? **

You have certain rights with respect to your Personal Data, including those set forth below. For more information about these rights, or to submit a request, please email [contact@gometa.io](mailto:contact@gometa.io). Please note that in some circumstances, we may not be able to fully comply with your request, such as if it is frivolous or extremely impractical, if it jeopardizes the rights of others, or if it is not required by law, but in those circumstances, we will still respond to notify you of such a decision. In some cases, we may also need to you to provide us with additional information, which may include Personal Data, if necessary to verify your identity and the nature of your request.

- Access: You can request more information about the Personal Data we hold about you and request a copy of such Personal Data.

- Withdrawal of Consent: If we are processing your Personal Data based on your consent (as indicated at the time of collection of such data), you have the right to withdraw your consent at any time. Please note, however, that if you exercise this right, you may have to then provide express consent on a case-by-case basis for the use or disclosure of certain of your Personal Data, if such use or disclosure is necessary to enable you to utilize some or all of our Services.
- Portability: You can ask for a copy of your Personal Data in a machine-readable format. You can also request that we transmit the data to another controller where technically feasible.

**Do we transfer EU Users&#39; Personal Data Outside the EU?**

The Services are hosted and operated in the United States (&quot;U.S.&quot;) through GoMeta and its service providers, and if you do not reside in the U.S., laws in the U.S. may differ from the laws where you reside. By using the Services, you acknowledge that any Personal Data about you, regardless of whether provided by you or obtained from a third party, is being provided to GoMeta in the U.S. and will be hosted on U.S. servers, and you authorize GoMeta to transfer, store and process your information to and in the U.S., and possibly other countries. You hereby consent to the transfer of your data to the U.S. as set forth herein. GoMeta is committed to the following principles regarding the collection and use of Personal Information transferred from the EU: (1) notice, (2) consent, (3) accountability for onward transfer, (4) security, (5) data integrity and purpose limitation, (6) access and (7) recourse, enforcement and liability with respect to all Personal Information received from within the EU (the &quot;Principles&quot;). The Principles require that we remain potentially liable if any third party processing Personal Information on our behalf fails to comply with these Principles (except to the extent we are not responsible for the event giving rise to any alleged damage).

Please contact us at [contact@gometa.io](mailto:contact@gometa.io) with any questions or concerns relating to our privacy practices.
